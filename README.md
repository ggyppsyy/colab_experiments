Experiments in Google Colabratory


These are just a collection of (mostly failed) experiments I tried on google colab over the past several months. They are pretty messy and mostly aimed at getting something running rather than readability. Also some were abandoned before compeletion when something else sparked my imagination and interrupted my work on them. There have been many experiments that haven't been uploaded, but most download data directly from my dropbox account and I haven't gotten around to deleting sensitive data related to my dropbox account so I can upload them yet.
